ML Project: Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

This project focuses on building and training three distinct machine learning models – Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), and Extra Trees (ET) – to predict cardiovascular risk using a dataset of 2000 rows and 13 features. The goal is to compare their performance in this classification task.

Project Overview

    Dataset: Cardiovascular_risk

        Size: 2000 rows, 13 columns.

        Purpose: Contains features relevant for predicting cardiovascular risk.

    Models Trained:

        Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP): A type of artificial neural network suitable for classification.

        Decision Tree (DT): A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.

        Extra Trees (ET): An ensemble learning method (like Random Forest) that fits a number of randomized decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset.
